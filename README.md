# The_Pokemon_Game
• Using Python’s Object-oriented programming language, we designed and created a real-world Pokémon game that
  combined Classes, Objects, Data Structures, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
• IntelliJ, where the user selects a starting Pokémon, then constructs a Map and a Trainer object. The user can buy Points,
  and Poke Balls, and enter Pokémon Hospital to fight with another Pokémon.
